```

## Usage

Just save an image to `public/favicon.png` (try to make sure it's at least 256x256). Additional configuration options are supplied in your `ember-cli-build.js` file:

```js
// ember-cli-build.js
var app = new EmberApp({
  favicons: {
    faviconsConfig: {
      // these options are passed directly to the favicons module
    }
  }
});
```

See the [favicons](https://github.com/haydenbleasel/favicons) module for details on the available configuration options.
