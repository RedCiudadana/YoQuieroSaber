 * Creates a function for debug logging, keyed by either an explicitly-given
 * namespace or the container key of the object it's attached to.
 *
 * Logging can then be enabled during debugging based on globbing of keys.
 * For instance, to enable logging for all routes, you could enter this in the
 * developer console:
 *   debug.enable('route:*');
 *
 * Or, to enable all logging:
 *   debug.enable('*');
 *
 * Logging preferences are persisted in local storage, and you'll need to reload
 * the page for changes to take effect.
